# Hospital Management System Data Cleaning and EDA

## Project Overview

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **SQL** on a Hospital Management System dataset. The aim is to prepare the dataset for further analysis, identify trends, and gain insights into hospital operations.

## Contents

- **Data Cleaning Queries**: SQL queries designed to clean and preprocess the raw data. [Get the code here.](https://github.com/ayeshamala/hospital_management_system/blob/main/healthcare_management_system_data_cleaning.sql)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis Queries**: SQL queries to analyze various aspects of hospital operations, patient demographics, and treatment outcomes. [Get the code here.](https://github.com/ayeshamala/hospital_management_system/blob/main/healthcare_management_system_EDA.sql)

## Data Source

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. [Download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anouskaabhisikta/healthcare-management-system)

## Key SQL Concepts and Techniques Used
The SQL concepts and techniques used in these queries are:
- Joins (INNER, LEFT)
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Aggregate Functions (e.g. SUM(), COUNT(), AVG())
- Grouping data using GROUP BY
- Ordering Results with ORDER BY
- Data Manipulation (SET, UPDATE, DELETE)
- String Functions (e.g. CONCAT(), SUBSTRING(), LOWER(), UPPER())
- Date and Time Functions (e.g., DATE_FORMAT())
- Conditional Logic with CASE Statements

## Exploratory Data Analysis Questions

The following questions were answered using the dataset with SQL queries: 

1. How many patients have booked appointments? 
2. How many appointments were scheduled in each month?
3. How many appointments were scheduled in each year?
4. What are the most common reasons for appointments?
5. What is the average billing amount per patient?
6. How many unique doctors are in the dataset?
7. What is the distribution of doctors by specialization?
8. How many unique medical procedures are available?
9. What is the most common procedure performed?
10. What is the average cost of procedures?
11. What is the daily trend in appointment scheduling?
12. What is the weekly trend in appointment scheduling?
13. How many patients does each doctor see each month?
14. Which doctor has the highest number of patient appointments?
15. What is the total billing amount for each patient?
16. What is the ratio of patients to doctors across different specializations?
17. What is the total number of procedures performed by each doctor?
18. What percentage of patients have undergone multiple procedures?
19. Which days of the week have the highest number of appointments?
20. What is the trend in billing amounts over time?
